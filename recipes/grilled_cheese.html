    <h1>Awesome Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My husband and I were sick of frying grilled cheeses on the stove because you have so many pieces of bread to use, and you have to stand there for a long time if you feed up to six people like we do. So we came up with this idea.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18 slices Bread</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>9 slices chedder cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Butter one side of 9 slices of bread, and place butter-side down on a baking sheet. Arrange cheese on each slice of bread. Spread butter on 9 remaining slices of bread, and place them buttered-side up on top of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes. Flip the sandwiches, and bake an additional 6 to 8 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
